# cosmic ocean
this is a small experiment project to play with vectors and monochromatic palettes.

## description
currently, this game is somewhat similar to [paradox by rxi](https://rxi.itch.io/paradox), implementing a random generation of minimal state-machine NPC spaceships, starts and debris in the background and a main ship you pilot.

## controls
use WASD to move around, space to shoot, return to pause and escape to exit.

## source
this project uses the following software:
- [TIGR](https://github.com/erkkah/tigr) for rendering graphics, with some small modifications.
- [FastNoiseLite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite) for generating the environment.
